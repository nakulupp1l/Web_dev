BROWSER EVENTS
  if i click a button then only code runs
  eg: clicking,scroll,resize,etc

  what are EVENTS
  how to respond to EVENTS
  data stored in EVENTS
  stopping an EVENTS
  lifecycle of an EVENTS

   they are invisible but can be visible
   through monitorEvents() the fire of EVENTS

INTERFACE
class is a blueprint 
objects are reality

in JS interface is blueprint
Event target=interface implemented by objects
             that can recieve events and may have
             listeners for them.
             it has 3 methods :
             *addEventListener();
                 listen to event or respond to event or hook to event.
                 eg document,para,article,video,etc.
                 <event-target>.addEventListener(<event to listen for>,<function to run when event happen>);

             *removeEventListener();
                 we need to require same function so we make it seperately so that when we call it we are 
                 calling the same function(object)
                 eg. <event>.removeEventListener(<same event to listen>,<function name>);
             *dispatchEvent();
             it is top level interface or entity

event target <-- node <--element

Node=inherit from event target

Element=inherit from node

==   loose equality :: it allows type coersion(js will try to convert items being compareed into same datatype)
=== strict equality :: it prevents type coersion

PHASES OF EVENTS
   1.Capturing phase
       assuming u are finding 'p'
       html->body->div->p it is its capturing phase
       document.addEventListener(<event>,<function>,true);
   2.At target phase
       when it is at 'p' it is its at target phase
       for this we have to write on target only directly (will work for both true and false);
       o run code in the target phase, just add addEventListener to the target element â€” it 
       always runs at the target phase regardless of useCapture.
   3.Bubbling phase
       p->div->body->html is its bubbling phase
       it is by default 
    
    <eventType>.addEventListener(<type>,<function(listener)>,<useCapture>);

EVENT object
   When an event occurs, .addEventListener() function is an event object and it 
   contains alot if info. about event.
   when this addEventListener(--,func()) is executed the func() is provided with the event object which contains info about event

   let content=document.querySelector('#x');
   content.addEventListener('click',function(event){
   console.log(event);
   });

default Action
  say anchor tag : it by default a link to open a window
  it can be prevented using function like .preventDefault()
  let links=document.querySelectorAll('a');
  let link=links[1];
  link.addEventListener('click',function(event){
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log('Pagal banaya');
   })

 AVOID TOO MANY EVENTS(see code file)
 ............................................................
 how will you know that your html file is loaded?
    it has an event called DOMContentLoaded which will tell whether loaded or not
    necessary because after this only u will know be using script tag which applies on 
    html and css tags

    <html>
       <head> 
          <script>
               document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',func());
          </script>
       </head>
       <body>..</body>
    </html>
