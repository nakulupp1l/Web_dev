how to write effecient and performing code
event loop
measure speed of code

#Performance
   we have a std way to measure how long your code takes to run
   performance.now();
   it calculates timestamp
   t1=timestamp 1
   ..code
   t2=timestamp 2
   diff=t2-t1 will the time and it is accurate function

   reflow=calculation of dimensions etc when new element is added
   repaint=showing the new element pixel by pixel on screen 
   good practise is using fewest reflow and repaint
   it a process of calculating dimensions and position of page element and computationaly expensive task.
   
 *Document fragment:-
     add all para to a document fragment(it is a light weight document object)
     it donot have any reflow or repaint
     reflow and repaint is done when loaded to document

#Call Stack:-
    JS is a single threaded language(process one command at one time)
    Execution from top to bottom ;this is a synchronus language

    function x(){
        let a=document.createElement('p');
        a.textContent='abc';
        document.body.appendChild(a);
        y();
    }
    function y(){
        let a=document.createElement('p');
        a.textContent='xyz';
        document.body.appendChild(a);
    }
    x();

    nature of code is run to completion
    JS donot execute multiple lines/function at a same time
    
    so the execution in call stack is
    main()
    x() main()
    console.log() x() main()
    x() main()
    y() x() main()
    console.log() y() x() main()
    y() x() main()
    x() main()
    main()

#EVENT LOOP:-(see in notes)
   Synchronous (occuring at same time)
   Asynchronous (Event Listener)
